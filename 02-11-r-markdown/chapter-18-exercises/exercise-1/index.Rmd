```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
source("exercise.R")  # load analysis file
```

## This is my report!

I like writing **reports**

This is the code we will look at in class. This
is just plain old Markdown that lets you render
text in **bold** or _italics_. However, you can
put in a block of R code, and the document will
show the code and the results!

```{r example, include = FALSE}
library(knitr)
numbers <- runif(1:100)
hist(numbers)
numbers_mean <- mean(numbers) # get the mean

img_url <- "https://images.pexels.com/photos/1108099/pexels-photo-1108099.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=1&w=500"

img_markdown <- paste0("![puppies ](",img_url,")")

letters <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
numbers <- 1:4
df <- data.frame(letters = letters, numbers = numbers)
```

`r kable(df)`

The mean of the numbers happens to be **`r numbers_mean`**.

`r img_markdown`

```{r other_chunk}
print("hello world")
```
